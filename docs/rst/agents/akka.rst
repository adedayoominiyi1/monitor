Akka agent
##########

The Akka agent collects information about the running of the actor system; its actors and the dispatchers
that contain the threads the perform the logic in the actors' ``receive`` methods. It monitors both the
Scala and Java APIs.

Dependencies
============
To include this agent, add the ``org.eigengo.monitor % agent-akka % @version@`` to your project's
dependencies. The Akka output module is built using Scala 2.10.3 and Akka 2.2.0. It is compatible with
any 2.10 version of Scala.

The agent has no further dependencies; it can be added to any Scala or Java-based Akka project.

Collected information
=====================
The agent logs the following, always tagged by by the actor type, path and actor system name:

* the number of messages received,
* the number of actors,
* the queue size,
* amount of time that a given actor spends in the ``receive`` call,
* number of exceptions thrown by an actor;

in addition to monitoring the actors, we monitor the thread pool's performance. For the
``ForkJoinPool`` and ``ThreadPoolExecutor``, we record:

* the number of active threads,
* the number or running threads,
* the number of queued tasks,
* the thread pool size.

The values are reported under *keys* or *aspects*, and decorated with *tags*. The *aspects* are

==================================  ========  ====================================================
Aspect/key                          Type      Description
==================================  ========  ====================================================
``akka.actor.delivered``            counter   the number of delivered messages to the actor
``akka.actor.undelivered``          counter   the number of undelivered messages to the actor
``akka.actor.queue.size``           gauge     the actor's mailbox size
``akka.actor.duration``             gauge     the time (in milliseconds) of the ``receive`` method
``akka.actor.error``                counter   the number of exceptions in the ``receive`` method
``akka.actor.count``                gauge     the number of actors
``akka.pool.thread.count``          gauge     the number of threads in the pool
``akka.pool.running.thread.count``  gauge     the number of active / running threads in the pool
``akka.pool.queued.task.count``     gauge     the number of queued tasks in the pool
``akka.pool.size``                  gauge     the thread pool size
==================================  ========  ====================================================

The tags allow you to further identify the "source" of the gauge or counter. The tags identify the
specific actor path, actor type and actor system name. Consider the following code::

    package demo

    class DemoActor extends Actor {
      def receive: Receive = {
        case true  => Thread.sleep(10)
        case false => Thread.sleep(10); throw new RuntimeException("false")
      }
    }

    object Demo extends App {
      val system = ActorSystem("foo")
      val demo = system.actorOf(Props[DemoActor], "demo")
      demo ! true
      demo ! false
      demo ! "???"
    }

The tags for the ``demo`` actor will be ``akka.path://foo/user/demo``, ``akka.type:demo.DemoActor`` and
``akka.system:foo``. And we will record the following *aspects*:

* ``akka.actor.delivered`` |->| 2 (The messages ``true`` and ``false``.)
* ``akka.actor.delivered.Boolean`` |->| 2 (The messages ``true`` and ``false``.)
* ``akka.actor.undelivered`` |->| 1 (The message ``"???"``.)
* ``akka.actor.undelivered.String`` |->| 1 (The message ``"???"``.)
* ``akka.actor.queue.size`` |->| min 0, max 3 (The ``Thread.sleep(10)`` and ``tell`` calls.)
* ``akka.actor.duration`` |->| ~10 (Typically exactly 10, but could differ depending on switching.)
* ``akka.actor.error`` |->| 1 (The exception ``RuntimeException("false")``.)
* ``akka.actor.error.RuntimeException`` |->| 1 (The Exception ``throw new...``.)
* ``akka.actor.count`` |->| 1 (The ``demo`` instance)
* ``akka.pool.thread.count`` |->| 5 (Depending on the default configuration for the ``ActorSystem``.)
* ``akka.pool.running.thread.count`` |->| min 0, max 3 (The three calls to ``tell``.)
* ``akka.pool.queued.task.count`` |->| min 0, max 3 (The three calls to ``tell``.)
* ``akka.pool.size`` |->| 15 (Depending on the default configuration for the ``ActorSystem``.)

    $\rightarrow$

Notice that, in addition to the aspects listed above, notice the refinements of the
``akka.actor.delivered``, ``akka.actor.undelivered``, and ``akka.actor.error``. The refinements
include the type of the message recorded as delivered and undelivered, and the exception type.

This allows you to measure things like *total number of Boolean messages* or
*total number of IOExceptions thrown*.

Configuration
=============

The ``org.eigengo.monitor.agent.AgentConfigurationFactory`` class searches for a mandatory
configuration file at ``META-INF/monitor/agent.conf``. The configuration file must have this format:

.. code:: json

    org.eigengo.monitor.agent {
        output {
            class: "org.eigengo.monitor.output.datadog.StatsdCounterInterface"
        }

        akka {
            includeRoutees: false
            included: [
                "akka:*.com.company.project.module.TypeOfActor"
            ]
            sampling: [
                {
                    rate: 15
                    for: [ "akka:*.com.company.project.module.TypeOfActor" ]
                },
                {
                    rate: 4
                    for: [ "akka://default/user/*" ]
                }
            ]
            allowExclusions: false
            excluded: [
                "akka:*.com.company.project.module.UninterestingActor"
            ]
        }
    }


The aspect that monitors the actors in the ``ActorSystem`` can be configured to sample 1-in-n messages
to a given actor path or type.

Parameters
----------

.. tabularcolumns:: |l|l|p{11cm}|

========================  ========  ===========================================================================
Key                       Type      Description
========================  ========  ===========================================================================
``output.class``          string    An implementation of ``CounterInterface`` with a nullary (zero parameter)
                                    constructor
``akka.includeRoutees``   boolean   If ``true``, we tag routed actors with their own full actor path, as well
                                    as parent's path
``akka.included``         [string]  The actor classes or paths to monitor. We can match on class name or actor
                                    path. This list is currently treated as a conjunction---i.e. an actor must
                                    match all filters to be included
``akka.excluded``         [string]  The actor classes or paths to not monitor. Same syntax and rules as included
                                    and sampling
``akka.allowExclusions``  boolean   If ``false``, we only include 'included' actors, if ``true``, we include all
                                    but ``excluded`` actors
``akka.sampling``         [{}]      Defines the rate at which to sample messages for given actor paths or types
                                    This is optional---default is to sample every message
``akka.sampling.rate``    number    Sample every n`th` message to an actor filter (starting with the first)
``akka.sampling.for``     [string]  Associates the sampling rate with an actor filter. If an actor is included
                                    and matches this filter, we sample at the ``rate``. Syntax is the same
                                    as for included/excluded
========================  ========  ===========================================================================

The only configuration option that needs further clarification is the ``akka.includeRoutees``. It is
particularly useful if you have routed actors and you only want to report the aggregate values for the
router. For example, in round-robin configuration, information is tagged per actor:
``akka.path://default/user/bar/$a``, ``akka.path://default/user/bar/$b`` |...|
``akka.path://default/user/bar/$n`` as well in the parent: ``akka.path://default/user/bar``.

Type and path filters
---------------------

The actor path filter follows the usual Akka actor path syntax, but allows for wildcards. The expression
``akka://foo/user/bar`` includes the user actor with the name ``bar`` in the ``ActorSystem`` whose name
is ``foo``; the expression ``akka://foo/user/bar/*`` includes all children of the ``bar`` actor. The same
wildcard rules apply to the actor system name. Applying that to the expressions above, we can have
``akka://*/user/bar/*``, which matches all child actros of ``bar`` in an actor system with any name.

Similarly, the actor type filter drops the ``://`` string, includes the actor system name, and
the canonical class name of the actor. The only allowed wildcard applies to the actor system name.
Valid expressions are ``akka.foo.org.eigengo.monitor.SomeActor``, which  matches actor in class
``org.eigengo.monitor.SomeActor`` in the ``ActorSystem`` whose name is ``foo``, and
``akka.*.org.eigengo.monitor.SomeActor``, which matches actor in class ``org.eigengo.monitor.SomeActor``
in an actor system with any name.
